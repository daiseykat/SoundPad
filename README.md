SoundPad
========

Modern day song writers often write lyrics over beats in mp3 format. When writing lyrics you need the ability to jump around the track so you can work on separate sections, like the chorus, verse 1, outro, etc. You need the ability to jot down ideas, both as written lyrics and as recorded rough takes. The beatmaker and the song writer need the ability to collaborate. This is how songs are written. It's a process.

SoundPad would integrate the process of listening to SoundCloud files, segmenting and looping audio, writing lyrics, recording rough takes, sharing private files, and creating interaction between the song writer and the music producers - in one app.
